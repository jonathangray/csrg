.Ar file(s)
is displayed.
If a library (archive) is given,
.Nm 
displays a list for each
object archive member.
If
.Ar file
is not present,
.Nm
searches for the file
.Pa a.out
and if present, displays the symbol
table for
.Pa a.out .

.Tp Fl a
Display symbol table entries inserted for use by debuggers.
.Tp Fl g
Restrict display to external (global) symbols.
.Tp Fl n
Present results in numerical order.
.Tp Fl o
Display full path or library name of object on every line.
.Tp Fl p
Do not sort at all.
.Tp Fl r
Reverse order sort.
.Tp Fl u

.Tp Fl w

Each symbol name is preceded by its value (a blank field if the symbol
is undefined) and one of the following letters:
.Tw Ds
