to be ignored. The signal SIGQUIT may also be set
to be ignored.
If the standard output is a terminal, the standard output is
appended to the file
.Pa nohup.out
in the current directory.
If standard error is a terminal, it is directed to the same place
as the standard output.

.Nm Nohup
exits 1 if an error occurs, otherwise the exit status is that of
.Ar command  .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Tw Fl

If the output file
.Pa nohup.out
cannot be created in the current directory, the
.Nm nohup
utility uses the directory named by
.Ev HOME
to create the file.
