.Sh NAME
.Nm liszt
.Nd compile a Franz Lisp program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm liszt
.Op Fl mpqruwxCQST
.Op Fl e Ar form
.Op Fl o Ar objfile
.Op Ar name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Liszt
takes a file whose names ends in `.l' and compiles the FRANZ
LISP
code there leaving an object program on the file whose name is that of the
source with `.o' substituted for `.l'.
.Pp
The following options are interpreted by
.Nm liszt .
.Tw Fl
.Tp Fl e
Evaluate the given form before compilation begins.
.Tp Fl m
Compile a MACLISP
file, by changing the readtable to conform to
MACLISP
syntax and including a macro-defined compatibility package.
.Tp Fl o
Put the object code in the specified file, rather than the default `.o' file.
.Tp Fl p
places profiling code at the beginning of each non-local function.
If the lisp system is also created with profiling in it, this allows
function calling frequency to be determined (see
.Xr prof  1  . )
.Tp Fl q
Only print warning and error messages.
Compilation statistics and notes on correct but unusual constructs
will not be printed.
.Tp Fl r
place bootstrap code at the beginning of the object file, which when
the object file is executed will cause a lisp system to be invoked
and the object file fasl'ed in.
.Tp Fl u
Compile a UCI-lispfile, by changing the readtable to conform to
UCI-Lisp syntax and including a macro-defined compatibility package.
.Tp Fl w
Suppress warning diagnostics.
.Tp Fl x
Create a lisp cross reference file with the same name as the source
file but with  `.x' appended.
The program
.Xr lxref  1
reads this file and creates a human readable cross
reference listing.
.Tp Fl C
put comments in the assembler output of the compiler. Useful
for debugging the compiler.
.Tp Fl Q
Print compilation statistics and warn of strange constructs.
This is the default.
.Tp Fl S
Compile the named program and leave the assembler-language output on
the corresponding file suffixed `.s'.
This will also prevent the assembler language file from being assembled.
.Tp Fl T
send the assembler output to standard output.
.Tp
.Pp
If
no source file is specified, then the compiler will run interactively.
You will find yourself talking to the
.Xr lisp  1
top-level command interpreter.
You can compile a file by using the
function
.Nm liszt
(an nlambda) with the same arguments as you use on the command line.
For example to compile `foo', a MACLISP
file, you would use:
.Pp
.Dl (liszt \-m foo)
.Pp
Note that
.Nm liszt
supplies the ``.l'' extension for you.
