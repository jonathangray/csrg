.Sh NAME
.Nm rcp
.Nd remote file copy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rcp
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl k Ar realm
.Ar file1 file2
.Nm rcp
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl k Ar realm
.Ar file ...
.Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Rcp
copies files between machines.  Each
.Ar file
or
.Ar directory
argument is either a remote file name of the
form ``rname@rhost:path'', or a local file name (containing no `:' characters,
or a `/' before any `:'s).
.Pp
.Tp Fl r
If any of the source files are directories,
.Nm rcp
copies each subtree rooted at that name; in this case
the destination must be a directory.
.Tp Fl p
The
.Fl p
option causes
.Nm rcp
to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its copies the modification
times and modes of the source files, ignoring the
.Ar umask  .
By default, the mode and owner of
.Ar file2
are preserved if it already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file
modified by the
.Xr umask  2
on the destination host is used.
.Tp Fl k
The
.Fl k
option requests
.Nm rcp
to obtain tickets
for the remote host in realm
.Ar realm
instead of the remote host's realm as determined by
.Xr krb_realmofhost  3  .
.Tp
.Pp
If
.Ar path
is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative to
the login directory of the specified user
.Ar ruser
on
.Ar rhost  ,
or your current user name if no other remote user name is specified.
A
.Ar path
on a remote host may be quoted (using \e, ", or \(aa)
so that the metacharacters are interpreted remotely.
.Pp
.Nm Rcp
does not prompt for passwords; it performs remote execution
via
.Xr rsh  1  ,
and requires the same authorization.
.Pp
.Nm Rcp
handles third party copies, where neither source nor target files
are on the current machine.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cp 1 ,
.Xr ftp 1 ,
.Xr rsh 1 ,
.Xr rlogin 1
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm Rcp
appeared in 4.2 BSD.  The version of rcp described here
is new with 4.4BSD and is part of Kerberos.
.Sh BUGS
Doesn't detect all cases where the target of a copy might
be a file in cases where only a directory should be legal.
.Pp
Is confused by any output generated by commands in a
.Pa \&.login ,
.Pa \&.profile ,
or
.Pa \&.cshrc
file on the remote host.
.Pp
The destination user and hostname may have to be specified as
``rhost.rname'' when the destination machine is running the 4.2BSD
version of
.Nm rcp  .
