.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Memccpy
copies bytes from string
.I src
to string
.I dst.
If the character
.I c
(as converted to an unsigned char) occurs in the string
.IR src ,
the copy stops and a pointer to the byte after the copy of
.I c
in the string
.I dst
is returned.
Otherwise,
.I len
bytes are copied, and a NULL pointer is returned.
