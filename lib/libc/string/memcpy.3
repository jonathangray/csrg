.SH NAME
memcpy \- copy byte string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <string.h>

void *
memcpy(void *dst, const void *src, size_t len);
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Memcpy
copies
.I len
bytes from string
.I src
to string
.I dst
and returns the original value of
.IR dst .
.SH SEE ALSO
bcopy(3), memccpy(3), memmove(3), strcpy(3)
.SH STANDARDS
.IR Memcpy
conforms to ANSI X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C'').
.SH BUGS
In this implementation
.B memcpy
is implemented using
.IR bcopy (3),
and therefore the strings may overlap.
On other systems, copying overlapping strings may produce surprises.
A simpler solution is to not use
.IR memcpy .
